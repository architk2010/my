        <p>It took 156 Test matches for James Anderson to reach his 600-wicket record, a landmark he achieved by dismissing Pakistan’s captain Azhar Ali during the third Test on Tuesday.<br> <br>

            He is now the fourth-highest wicket-taker in Tests.The three bowlers with more wickets than him are all spinners—Sri Lanka’s Muttiah Muralitharan (800 wickets in 133 Tests) <br> <br>, Australia’s Shane Warne (708 wickets in 145 Tests)and India’s Anil Kumble (619 wickets in 132 Tests) <br> <br>.
            The next pacer after Anderson in the record books is retired Australian cricketer Glenn McGrath, with 563 Test wickets.<br> <br> Among current players, Anderson's teammate Stuart Broad holds the second highest number of Test wickets, at 514 <br> <br>.He then went past the record held by New Zealand’s Sir Richard Hadlee, who was the first cricketer to take 400 Test wickets.</p>
